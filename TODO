* More specs (eg; for use_template with a block)
* think some more about saving and record consistency. Settings don't get saved until we save the parent record. That may be OK but calling a getter should perhaps return the correct (albeit unsaved) value?
  - implement new_record? changed? (maybe even changes) methods
  - active record makes this hard to do in current form. We would actually need to build a second setting value when we change something and then replace the entire collection when we save the owner
